I ain't been this hurt ever
And we deserve better
When you see destruction, it's corruption, then it's vendetta
We can stand or settle, every black boy ain't just born ghetto
But we're in this bracket, police tactics, holding warm metal
Whether you a athlete or a actress, this is hard as ever
All just pose distractions,
moving backwards while we're all disheveled
Why we can't ignore this devil? My people's more than fed up
We just earn a fraction, when there's actually much more to give us
Riddled in these lies, oppressors wanna kill our strides
Though the only way that they can shake us up is to take lives?
It's cowardice
Fists hoisted high will leave them powerless
Dog this ain't new to us, it took too long just to acknowledge this
Black skin is amethyst, our melanin discovered
Spread our culture like Evangelists
Anunnaki tribes, yo there's bludgeoned black lives
Though it's constant, we can't be conditioned or desensitized
To break them stigmas, rise
Freedom Fighters, reuniting, please just be advised
We can wage together, break the penn to free my guys
Every fiber in me says that we ain't built for this demise
Overstand what hatred does, but don't let it eat you alive

First time looking in the mirror
Another one resting in the fight
Rolling the dice to get the game going
The game gon' take another life
And I know it makes no sense
Can everyone be selfish?
I'll cry about it 'cause
I don't wanna, I don't wanna die

When the music from the soul, boy you Future-Proof
Throw my fam a couple bucks, know they could use a few
Yeah, I wish that I had more, but I make due with two
Just monitor what type of energy is fueling you
Our ancestors, our antennas
Reaching for a place
Somewhere outta space
Or just somewhere
Now I'm running circles in my labyrinth
Many just avoid the pain, I had to decongest it
Fools just manifest it
I was there without this motive, rolled over in my emotions
I ain't listen when you said "things'll change when you get older"
Now it's funny, I'm hearing whisphers on my conscious
And though it hurts to reminisce, the thoughts with you are timeless
Couldn't wait to tell you 'bout how I got some records out
Always lent an ear to me and always down to check it out
Tensions boiling over, that shit creeping through my dome
I fear another death so much, I dread just picking up my phone
My fortitude is high, I saw my homies in the sky
Seeking for another chance, on this planet we reside
Wish that I could hold your hand, wish that we could be together
I learned the hard way, that nothing seems to last forever
Or does it?

First time looking in the mirror
Another one resting in the fight
Rolling the dice to get the game going
The game gon' take another life
And I know it makes no sense
Can everyone be selfish?
I'll cry about it 'cause
I don't wanna, I don't wanna die
