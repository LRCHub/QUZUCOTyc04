Who's a pretty boy then?
Your girlfriend says when she's got you wearing a tie
You're looking like a puff and you think I've had enough
Stop and take a look at yourself for a while
And you'll know it's time to say

Cheerio, cheerio
Toodle pip, toodle pip
This is our last goodbye
Don't cry
Cheerio, cheerio
Toodle pip, toodle pip
Our last farewell, goodbye

Sitting watching Coronation Street
You decide to put your feet up, just about comfy in your seat
And she says, I'm feeling hungry
If she sends you out for a bag of fish'n'chips
You'll know it is time to say

Cheerio, cheerio
Toodle pip, toodle pip
This is our last goodbye
Don't cry
Cheerio, cheerio
Toodle pip, toodle pip
Our last farewell, goodbye

Need a bit of shut-eye so you lie on the couch
She is yapping in the background
Baby's things wedding rings
It's not for you, she will never keep her mouth shut
You have to tell her now, once and for all
'Cause now it's time to say

Cheerio, cheerio
Toodle pip, toodle pip
This is our last goodbye
Don't cry
Cheerio, cheerio
Toodle pip, toodle pip
Our last farewell, goodbye
