Watching him fade minutes before the car pulled up outside
It was just after 3pm

His eyes were open
But we were guessing he wasn't seeing straight out of them
No, he didn't have to wait much longer

He'd go just after I left
And now he's merging
Under a railway sleeper
With the ferns and the creeper roots
Entwining into his paws
